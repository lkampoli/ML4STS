This project aims at investigating the usage of machine learning
algorithms for the solution of high-speed (viscous and inviscid,
reacting and non-reacting) non-equilibrium flows according to a
state-to-state (STS) formulation. Several machine learning methods,
including neural networks are considered. In this framework,
the following tasks have been identified:

- [x] Regression of transport coefficients
- [x] Regression of chemical reaction rates
- [x] Regression of chemical relaxation terms
- [x] Coupling of machine learning with ODE solver
- [x] Coupling of machine learning with PDE solver
- [x] Solution of Euler and Navier-Stokes equations with NN
- [ ] RNN/LSTM for ODE integration
- [ ] CNN for solution inference
- [ ] GAN for data generation and super-resolution

## Requisites
Assuming an available python3 version, the following 
packages may be required in order to run some tasks:

* [scikit-learn 0.23](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
* [keras](https://keras.io/)
* [tensorflow 1.14.0](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
* [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/)
* [dask](https://dask.org/)
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/)

## Nomenclature
In the directory tree, the following abbreviations have been used:

* DT  - Decision Tree
* SVM - Support Vector Machine
* KR  - Kernel Ridge
* LDA - Linear Discriminant Analysis
* QDA - Quadratic Discriminant Analysis
* PCA - Principal Component Analysis
* SVD - Singular Value Decomposition
* kNN - Nearest Neighbors
* GP  - Gaussian Processes
* NB  - Naive Bayes
* RF  - Random Forest
* ET  - Extreme Tree
* GB  - Gradient Boosting
* HGB - Histogram-Based Gradient Boosting
* MLP - Multi-layer Perceptron
* NN  - Neural Network

## Regression of transport coefficients
- [x] model implementation for shear, bulk viscosity, thermal conductivity and thermal/mass diffusion
- [x] hyperparameters tuning
- [ ] solve the problem of big data for the mass diffusion (probably with Dask and/or cluster)
- [ ] coupling with Spark CFD solver
- [ ] define optimal interface Fortran -> Python

## Regression of chemical reaction rate coefficients, k_ci
- [x] model implementation
- [x] hyperparameters tuning

## Regression of chemical relaxation terms, R_ci
- [x] model implementation
- [x] hyperparameters tuning

## Coupling of machine learning with ODE solver
- [x] model implementation
- [ ] find optimal coupling strategy

## Coupling of machine learning with PDE solver
- [x] model implementation
- [ ] find optimal coupling strategy

## Euler_1d_shock_STS
In this directory, I try to solve the full system of Euler equations for a one-dimensional reacting shock flow.
The directory contains both the `.py` and `.ipynb` files, for convenience, but they are the same.
The `PINN.py` deals with the solution of the Euler equations without STS.
The `PINN_STS.py` deals with the solution of the Euler equations with STS.

- [x] model implementation
- [ ] hyperparameters tuning
- [ ] re-write in compact form
- [ ] bigfix
