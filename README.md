# Machine Learning for State-to-State
This project aims at investigating the usage of machine learning algorithms (MLAs) for the solution of high-speed (viscous and inviscid, reacting and non-reacting) non-equilibrium flows according to the state-to-state (STS) formulation. Several machine learning methods, including neural networks (NNs) will be considered. In this framework, the following tasks have been identified:

* Regression of transport coefficients
* Regression of chemical reaction rate coefficients
* Coupling of machine learning with CFD solver
* Solution of Euler and Navier-Stokes equations with NN

# Requisites
Assuming an available python3 version, the following packages are necessary:
* [scikit-learn 0.23](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
* [keras](https://keras.io/)
* [tensorflow 1.14.0](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
* [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/)
* [cffi](https://cffi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* [dask](https://dask.org/)
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/)
