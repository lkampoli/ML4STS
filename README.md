# NN_STS
Neural Networks for STS approach

In this work, we investigate the possibility of using neural networks (NNs) and physics-informedneural networks (PINNs) to
perform tasks:

1. regression of transport coefficients and relaxation source terms
2. infer the solution of the Euler equations in high-speed non-equilibrium reacting flows adopting a state-to-state (STS)
   description considering N_2/N binary mixture and only dissociation/recombination processes.
